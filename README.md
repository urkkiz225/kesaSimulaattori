# kesaSimulaattori
A WIP game about the Finnish summer.

Launch the game with all the game files in the same folder!

## FOR NON ZIP DOWNLOADERS

I uploaded the largest files with git large file support (LFS). This means that in order for non-zip downloaders to properly download the game, youll have to run: 

git clone https://github.com/urkkiz225/kesaSimulaattori

in git bash. Git pull origin is untested, but im pretty sure you need high level access for that

Otherwise the zip version can be found in the "releases"-tab.
